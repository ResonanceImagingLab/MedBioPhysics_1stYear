    Step-by-step code blocks to build confidence in programming

1. (ongoing) Introduction and how-to

2. Biomechanics - Kinematics

    For Biomechanics, the strongest unifying theme is:

    The human body as a system of levers and forces
    Chapter 2: Biomechanics

    2.1 Static Forces and Balance → Notebook 2A
    2.2 Levers and Joint Loading → Notebook 2A
    2.3 Motion and Limb Swing → Notebook 2B
    2.4 Energy, Efficiency, and Limits → Notebook 2B

    “Chapter 2A explains how forces act on the body.
    Chapter 2B explains how the body moves when those forces are applied.”
