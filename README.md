# Simulating Life: Physics for Medicine and Biology — Jupyter Notebook Companion (OER)

⚠️ **Work in Progress**  
This repository is actively under development. Content, examples, and notebooks may change as the course evolves.

If you encounter **any issues** (errors, confusing instructions, notebooks not running as expected):
- Please **contact your instructor or TA**, **or**
- Start a **Discussion** or **Issue** on the GitHub repository page

Your feedback is valuable and helps improve this resource for everyone.

## 📘 What is this repository?

This repository contains **Jupyter notebooks that accompany the open educational resource (OER) textbook** for *Physics in Medicine & Biology*.

The notebooks are designed to:
- Reinforce key concepts from the textbook
- Provide **interactive, visual explanations** of physical principles in medicine
- Allow students to explore models by **changing parameters and re-running cells**
- Support students with **no prior programming experience**

You do **not** need to be a programmer to use these notebooks.

---

## 🧭 How this repository is organized

- Each notebook corresponds to a **chapter or subsection** of the textbook  
- Notebooks are scaffolded from **very beginner-friendly** to more advanced (optional) explorations  
- Advanced code is always **pre-filled** — you are never expected to write complex code from scratch

---

## 🚀 Where to start (very important)

👉 **Start here first:**

### **`Ch00_setupJupyterNotebook.ipynb`**

This notebook will:
- Help you install or verify the required software
- Teach you how to open and run Jupyter notebooks
- Confirm that your computer environment is working correctly
- Show you how to fix common setup problems

**Do not skip this step.**

## 📖 Related textbook guidance

For additional help getting started, you should also refer to:
- **Chapter 1 of the textbook**, which provides:
  - Context for why notebooks are used
  - Instructions on downloading and updating files
  - Guidance for students with no coding background

The notebook and textbook are designed to be used **together**.

## 🧠 What you are (and are not) expected to know

You are expected to:
- Run notebook cells
- Change numbers and re-run cells
- Interpret plots and results
- Use notebooks as an exploratory learning tool

You are **not** expected to:
- Know Python in advance
- Understand every line of code
- Debug complex programming issues on your own

If something doesn’t work or doesn’t make sense — **ask**.

---

## 💬 Getting help

If something goes wrong:
1. Re-read the instructions in the notebook cell
2. Restart the kernel and re-run cells from the top
3. Ask a **TA or instructor**
4. Post a question in the **GitHub Discussions** tab

Learning happens best when questions are shared.

## 🌱 Final note

These notebooks are part of an **open educational resource** developed to make medical biophysics more accessible, visual, and interactive.

Thank you for your patience while this resource continues to grow — and for helping improve it by reporting issues or asking questions.
